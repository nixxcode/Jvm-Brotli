# Jvm-Brotli: Lightweight, cross-platform Java library for the Brotli compression format

Making Brotli usable in Java can be a very tricky and time consuming exercise. The Brotli code is written in c/c++ and is platform dependent. This makes the use of JNI bindings mandatory. 

The bindings are provided by Google, but it is still left to the Java developer to compile the Brotli and JNI source files individually for every platform they wish to support. Anybody who has dealt with JNI bindings and native code in the past, will already be familiar with the problems and complexity this approach can add to a Java project.

**This is where Jvm-Brotli comes in**. The goal of this project is to provide easy access to the Brotli compression algorithm for Java developers on all platforms. 

Jvm-Brotli aims to:

- Take the original c/c++ and Java code from [google/brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli), keeping it as close as possible to the original.
- Compile it on multiple platforms
- Package the pre-compiled native libraries into JARs, making them available via maven central
- Provide source code with project breakdown and build instructions, to make forking and building as easy as possible for platforms that are not yet supported.

## General Information

* Project website: (coming soon)
* Documentation: (coming soon)
* Chat: (coming soon)
* Licensing: (coming soon)

## Supported Platforms

* Windows (32 and 64 bit) - Tested on Windows 7 and 10
* Linux (64 bit) - Tested on Ubuntu 18.04
* Mac OSX - Tested on Mojave

#### Support Coming Soon

* Linux on ARM processors (64 bit) - The build files are ready, just haven't had the opportunity to do the actual build

## Getting Started

Jvm-Brotli is designed with ease of use in mind. To include it in your Maven project, simply add the following dependency to your pom.xml

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.nixxcode.jvmbrotli</groupId>
    <artifactId>jvmbrotli</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```
That's all! You don't need to worry about what platform you're on, as long as it's supported. The correct native library will be downloaded automatically as an additional Maven dependency. 

**The same applies for transitive dependencies as well!** You don't need to worry about others getting the wrong native library when they include your project.

The **optional** tag is not mandatory, but is highly recommended. It gives your dependents the option to keep their code 100% platform-independent by opting to exclude Jvm-Brotli

If your platform is not supported, but you still want to use Jvm-Brotli right now, please scroll down to the "Build Instructions" section. 

We would also really appreciate it if you could create an issue and request support for your platform. Remember, the goal of this project is to make Jvm-Brotli available on as many platforms as possible. We can make it happen with your help!

### Usage Examples

Please see the quick snippets below to get started. In addition, fully functional example code  can be found [here](https://github.com/nixxcode/jvm-brotli/tree/release-prep/jvmbrotli/src/test/java/com/nixxcode/jvmbrotli/examples)

#### Encoding a stream:
```java
// Init file input and output
FileInputStream inFile = new FileInputStream(filePath);
FileOutputStream outFile = new FileOutputStream(filePath + ".br");

// If being used to compress streams in real-time, I do not advise a quality setting above 4 due to performance
Encoder.Parameters params = new Encoder.Parameters().setQuality(4);

// Initialize compressor by binding it to our file output stream
BrotliOutputStream brotliOutputStream = new BrotliOutputStream(outFile, params);

int read = inFile.read();
while(read > -1) { // -1 means EOF
    brotliOutputStream.write(read);
    read = inFile.read();
}

// It's important to close the BrotliOutputStream object. This also closes the underlying FileOutputStream
brotliOutputStream.close();
inFile.close();

```

#### Decoding a stream:
```java
// Init file input and output
FileInputStream inFile = new FileInputStream(filePath);
FileOutputStream outFile = new FileOutputStream(decodedfilePath);

// Initialize decompressor by binding it to our file input stream
BrotliInputStream brotliInputStream = new BrotliInputStream(inFile);

int read = brotliInputStream.read();
while(read > -1) { // -1 means EOF
    outFile.write(read);
    read = brotliInputStream.read();
}

// It's important to close the BrotliInputStream object. This also closes the underlying FileInputStream
brotliInputStream.close();
outFile.close();
```
