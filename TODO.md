# TODO LIST

- Update readme to indicate the project uses semantic versioning
- Update readme to offer more explanation about the <optional> tag for Maven dependencies
- Update readme to explain that supported platforms are based on JVM versions, NOT OS versions
- Provide source code with project breakdown and build instructions, to make forking and building as easy as possible (remove the bit about "for platforms not yet supported")
